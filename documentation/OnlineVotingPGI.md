# Project General Information

Group Name: TRIO
Project Title: Online Voting System

## A. Problem Statement:
1. Accessibility and Inclusivity: Despite advancements in technology, many eligible voters still face barriers to participating in elections, such as lack of access to the internet or digital literacy. This research aims to investigate how the Online Voting System can be designed to ensure that all demographics, including the elderly and those in rural areas, can participate effectively.
2. User Experience and design: As modern technology increasingly shift towards digital platforms, the user experience associated with online voting systems has emerged as a critical factor influencing voter participation and the integrity of electoral processes. Despite the convenience offered by online voting, numerous issues have been identified that hamper its effectiveness, accessibility, and overall user satisfaction. The goal is to develop a user-centered design approach that enhances accessibility, simplifies the voting experience, fortifies security measures, and promotes transparency. Through research and testing, we aim to create an online voting system that instills confidence in voters, encouraging higher turnout and active participation in the democratic process.
3. Even in places with strong internet connectivity, conducting remote voting might be challenging in some remote locations due to logistical challenges or difficult access. The goal is to make the voters in the remote area who are also capable of connecting to the internet cast their votes.

## B. Project Description:
The Online Voting System aims to streamline the electoral process enhance voter accessibility, and ensure the accuracy and integrity of election results. By enabling secure, accessible, and transparent voting through an online platform. This system is designed to enhance voter participation, reduce the costs associated with traditional voting methods, and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the voting process. With the growing need for secure and efficient voting mechanisms, this system will leverage modern technology to facilitate online voting, minimizing the logistical challenges of traditional voting methods.

The Online Voting System represents a significant advancement in how democratic processes, promoting greater voter engagement and participation that can be conducted in the digital age. By ensuring security, accessibility, and transparency, aims to foster greater participation in elections, strengthen the democratic process, and civic engagement and restore trust in electoral integrity. The system also strives to build confidence in democratic processes while ensuring that every vote counts. Through careful planning, development, and stakeholder engagement, this project can revolutionize the voting experience for millions of citizens. As technology continues to evolve, this system positions itself as an essential modern tool for future elections.


## C. Project Objectives:

To develop an online voting system to streamline various types of voting, e.g. Non-profit organization voting, surveys or polls, etc. with the following features:

1. Anonymize votes: the user can be anonymous when voting, preserving their privacy.
2. User authentication: the user can create an account to see their voting history.
3. Ballot Designing: The voters can get the basic information and background of the candidate. They’ll be able to see the 
   credibility of the candidate, prompting them to make an informed decision.
4. Mobile compatibility: voters are able to access the voting form using a mobile device. Not only is this feature convenient, but some voters don't have access to it on their desktops or laptops
5. User-friendly interface: simple is better than complex. A minimal interface is more appealing than having a ton of UI elements.
6. Confidentiality and Integrity: online voting system faces critical challenges in ensuring confidentiality to protect voter identities and choices from unauthorized access, as well as integrity to guarantee that votes are accurately cast, counted, and reported without tampering, thereby maintaining public trust in the democratic process.
